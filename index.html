        <p>Detonator Dash is an exciting grid-based game where players aim to achieve a high score by collecting coins and keys while avoiding hidden bombs.
           The game consists of a grid with various elements, including coins, keys, bombs, and power-ups. 
           Players must strategically click on tiles to reveal coins and keys, earning points for each collected coin and key. 
           However, clicking on a bomb ends the game. The challenge increases with each level as the grid expands, and is populated randomly with more bombs.
           Reveal tiles on the grid by clicking on them.
           Collect coins for 10 points each and keys for 50 points.
           Receive visual cues (blue or red color) indicating proximity to the key when clicking on a coin.
           Encounter hidden power-ups that enhance gameplay.
           Progress through levels with increasing difficulty and larger grids.
           View the number of lives and the current score.
