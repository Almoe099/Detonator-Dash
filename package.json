  "description": "Detonator Dash is an exciting grid-based game where players aim to achieve a high score by collecting coins and keys while avoiding hidden bombs. The game consists of a grid with various elements, including coins, keys, bombs, and power-ups. Players must strategically click on tiles to reveal coins and keys, earning points for each collected coin and key. However, clicking on a bomb ends the game. The challenge increases with each level as the grid expands, and is populated randomly with more bombs.",
